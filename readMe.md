This is my first attempt at building a website. Start by opening the 
index.html file found in the html folder. The look of the site
is pretty much done, but the functionality still needs work.
I have designed my site from a mobile first standpoint. 

The site is designed from an object-oriented programming
standpoint. All of my objects are created from a single 
constructor function and a for loop. 

Starting from the index page you can browse multiple crate engines
and various parts on the 'Hemi', 'Big-block', and 'Small-block'
pages adding items to the 'Cart' as necessary through the
increment, decrement, and cart buttons. Since this is not
completed, the parts are not yet displaying on the cart page. They
are in sessionStorage and can be viewed in the console. 

Update: 9-27-19...My second submission.

Functionality is now complete. The user can select any number of 
items and have them added to the cart page. Their individual item 
prices are calculated and then subtotaled. The user can also delete 
items from the cart and have the page "re-subtotal". After 
subtotaling, the item's taxes and shipping are calculated and added 
to the subtotal for the final cost. After all input fields are filled 
the form can be 'submitted'. The cart is completely dynamic, as is 
the receipt modal, providing a distinctly individual experience for 
each user.

I added functionality for validation on the input boxes for 'shipping 
info', 'billing info', and the 'credit card section'.  At the end of 
the process when the submit button is clicked, I designed a mostly 
dynamically created modal to act as a receipt for the user, which 
they can print out for their records.

Update: 10-18-19...My final submission.

Changes have been made to the landing page and the file directory
as suggested, as well as a few other small changes.
